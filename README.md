# CoolBox
#### A blender like tool box for krita
#### Improved for Tablet PC

## Description
Just an attempt to build a blender link toolbox, to see how people react to the new design.

## Features
- Showing Subtools after Mouse Hovering
- Closing Popup Panel Automatically when Mouse Focus Out

## Setup
Download the zip file from the releases tab and go to Tools -> Scripts -> Import Python Plugin. Follow the instructions there. After restarting Krita, you can see a new docker added to the Settings -> Dockers menu called CoolBox, just activate that and deactivate the original toolbox.

## Usage
Click on the respective tool to activate, long press if you need to open the sub tools popup. Remember if you release the mouse the popup will close with the last highlighted tool as active.

## Feedback
Opening an thread in Krita Artists or an issue in Github works, PRs are welcomed.
